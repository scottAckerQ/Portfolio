        <p>In line with the essence of life simulation games, a diverse array of Non-Player Characters (NPCs) awaits interaction in this game.
             Although the dialog content is pending implementation, the comprehensive system governing the display and selection 
             of lines is fully functional.</p>
        <p>The primary objective of this system is to ensure an extensive range of dialogues, preventing players from encountering 
            repetitive remarks. Immersing players in the unfolding narratives of characters stands as an important objective 
            for this game, fostering engagement and depth in every interaction.</p>
