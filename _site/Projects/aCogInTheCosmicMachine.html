        <img src="\assets\images\Cog\Random Event Gif.gif">
        <p>My primary task on this project was to combine programmatic efforts in Unity with the interactive story software called INK.
             All of the game's text was composed within INK, and subsequently read and printed to a Driver script I wrote.</p>
        <p>Every aspect of narrative events in the game, including player choices, narrative branching, and the various methods 
            by which the narrative affected gameplay were integrated by myself. </p>
        <p>As shown in this gif, I worked to ensure that all transitions between gameplay and narrative were both seamless 
            and satisfying. No choice is forgotten, and all individual events are tracked for a stellar experience.</p>

        <p>I led the creation of an interface that allowed the design team to implement events without needing 
            to delve into the game's underlying code.</p>
        <p>All necessary aspects of an event's creation are included, such as images, music, available choices
             for every story segment, and how player stats are altered or required by an event. </p>
        <p>INK, the program we used to create the game's story, was not innately compatible with anything besides 
            reading out the choices that a player made. As such, I devised clever solutions to further link Unity with INK and 
            ultimately met every challenge that the game required.</p>
